/**
 * Standard normal tables for Z and related methods
 *
 * A standard normal table, also called the unit normal table or Z table,
 * is a mathematical table for the values of Φ, which are the values of the
 * cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution.
 *
 * It is used to find the probability that a statistic is observed below,
 * above, or between values on the standard normal distribution, and by extension,
 * any normal distribution.
 *
 * Since probability tables cannot be printed for every normal distribution,
 * as there are an infinite variety of normal distributions,
 * it is common practice to convert a normal to a standard normal
 * and then use the standard normal table to find probabilities.
