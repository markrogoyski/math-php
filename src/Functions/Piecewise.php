    /**
     * Validate that our inputs satisfy the conditions of a piecewise function,
     * and then assign our inputs as the object parameters.
     *
     * In our $intervals array, each interval should contain two numbers [a, b].
     * We can optionally add two booleans to an interval, signifying the openness
     * of a and b, respectfully (true means open, false means closed). If boolean
     * arguments are not supplied, the interval will be assumed to be closed.
     *
     * Examples:
     *     1. [0, 2, true, false] means an interval from 0 to 2, where 0 is open
     *        (exclusive) and 2 is closed (inclusive).
     *     2. [-10, 10] means an closed (inclusive) interval from -10 to 10
     *
     * A number of conditions need to be met for a piecewise function:
     *     o We must provide the same number of intervals as callback functions
     *     o Each function in our $functions array needs to be callable
     *     o Each interval must contain precisely 2 numbers, optionally 2
     *     o An interval defined as a point (e.g. [2, 2]) must be closed at both ends
     *     o The numbers in an interval must be increasing. Given [a, b] then b >= a.
     *     o Two intervals cannot overlap. This means that if two intervals share
     *       a start and end-point, the point must be closed on both sides. Also,
     *       we cannot start or end an interval in the middle of another interval.
     *
     * @param  array $intervals Array of intervals
     *                          Example: [[-10, 0, false, true], [0, 2], [3, 10]]
     * @param  array $functions Array of callback functions
     *
     * @throws Exception if the number of intervals and functions are not the same
     * @throws Exception if any function in $functions is not callable
     * @throws Exception if any interval in $intervals does not contain 2 numbers
     * @throws Exception if any interval [a, b] is decreasing, or b < a
     * @throws Exception if an interval is a point that is not closed
     * @throws Exception if two intervals share a point that is closed at both ends
     * @throws Exception if one interval starts or ends inside another interval
